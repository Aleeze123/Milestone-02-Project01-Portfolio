          I&apos;m a passionate web developer and creative enthusiast at the Governor Sindh IT Initiative (GIAIC). With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript, I&apos;m diving deep into Next.js and exploring the exciting world of cloud technologies.

As an animator and graphic designer, I love crafting visually captivating content that seamlessly blends art and technology. Video editing is another passion of mine, where I bring stories to life through dynamic visuals.

Right now, I&apos;m working on a Next.js application and enhancing my skills with React. Join me on this exciting journey of innovation and creativity in web development!
